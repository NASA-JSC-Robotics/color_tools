# Color Tools

This project contains a number of repos for perception applications using color-based localization.
In particular, given an image and registered depth map, the [color_blob_centroid](./color_blob_centroid/README.md) package contains functions for identifying color blob centers and their respective poses.

For more information, refer to each individual package in this repository.
